# AutoInstallBashScripts
A bash script to install what I think are necessary applications. Thanks to Big Daddy Linux, Skrappjaw, and many others.

### Instructions
1. Download bash script to a folder (ex: /Documents or /Downloads)
2. Right click on file to give execute permissions
3. Go to terminal and change to directory where you put downloaded file (ex: cd Downloads)
4. Type in terminal `./installscript` to run
	- You may also need to type `chmod +x ./installscript` if you forgot to do step 2
5. A menu will open up with selectable packages to install
6. Select packages and click OK
7. Packages will auto-install
Tested with Elementary Loki, Ubuntu 17.10, Ubuntu 18.04 Beta, Mate 18.04, and Pop_OS! but should work with any Ubuntu-based distribution.
